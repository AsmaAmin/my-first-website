                    <p>
                        One of the skills that a Software Engineer needs is to have good communication. If a Software Engineer does not have good communication skills, how are they supposed to communicate with your boss, or talk to other engineers about a large project that is due (Career Focus 2)? Another skill Software Engineers need to have experience in programming, without this skill, Software Engineering is basically useless. Having experience in programming is a skill that Software Engineers need to know because this is the skill that will help an engineer build programs (Career Focus 2). Software Engineers need to be product oriented people, being product oriented is important because without this skill engineers wonâ€™t get anything done, they will be focused on other things when they need to be focused on their task is (Career Focus 2). Software Engineers need to have knowledge of different programming languages, different languages do different things and if an engineer only knows one of many different languages then they will be limited on the work that they are

                    <p> 
                        A leaf (plural leaves) is a dorsiventrally flattened organ of a vascular plant and is the principal lateral appendage of the stem, usually borne above ground and specialized for photosynthesis. The leaves and stem together form the shoot. Leaves are collectively referred to as foliage, as in "autumn foliage".

                <h3>Animal</h3>
                <p><b>Animals</b> are multicellular eukaryotic organisms that form the biological kingdom Animalia. With few exceptions, animals consume organic material, breathe oxygen, are able to move, can reproduce sexually, and grow from a hollow sphere of cells, the blastula, during embryonic development. Over 1.5 million living animal species have been describedâ€”of which around 1 million are insectsâ€”but it has been estimated there are over 7 million animal species in total. Animals range in length from 8.5 millionths of a metre to 33.6 metres (110 ft). They have complex interactions with each other and their environments, forming intricate food webs. The kingdom Animalia includes humans, but in colloquial use the term animal often refers only to non-human animals. The scientific study of animals is known as zoology.
